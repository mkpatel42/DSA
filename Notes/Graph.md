## What is Graph?
![img_3.png](Assets/img_3.png)

A graph is a group of points (called vertices or nodes) that are connected by lines (called edges).

### Vertices (Nodes)
These are the individual points in the graph. They represent things like cities, people, or any entities.

### Edges
Edges are the lines that connect the vertices. They can be one-way (directed) or two-way (undirected).

## Types of Graphs

![img_1.png](Assets/img_1.png)

### Undirected Graph
- In this type of graph, the edges allow travel in both directions.
- For example, if there is a connection between nodes (u, v), itâ€™s the same as the connection (v, u).

### Directed Graph (Digraph)
- Here, the edges have a direction, meaning you can only travel one way between nodes.
- For instance, the connection (u, v) is different from (v, u). We can consider that as one way road, there is a way to go from city u to city v. But you can't go back.

### Cyclic and Acyclic Graphs
![img_2.png](Assets/img_2.png)
- A **cyclic graph** contains loops or cycles, meaning you can return to a starting point.
- A **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)** is a directed graph that has no cycles.

## Structure of Graphs
- A graph may or may not contain cycles.
- Some graphs are open (like a line) while others are closed (like a circle).

## Path in a Graph
A path is a way to connect different nodes through edges, where each node can only appear once in that path.

## Degree of a Node

### Undirected Graphs
- The degree of a node is the number of edges connected to it.
- The total degree of the graph is twice the number of edges since each edge connects two nodes.

### Directed Graphs
- **Indegree**: The number of edges coming into a node.
- **Outdegree**: The number of edges going out from a node.

## Edge Weight
- Some edges have weights, which can represent costs or distances between nodes.
- If no weight is given, it is assumed to be 1 by default.

# Graph Representation

Graphs can be represented in various ways in Java. The two most common representations are:

## 1. Adjacency Matrix

An adjacency matrix is a 2D array used to represent a graph. The rows and columns represent the vertices, and the values in the matrix indicate whether there is an edge between the vertices.

### Example

```java
class Graph {
    private int[][] adjacencyMatrix;

    public Graph(int numberOfVertices) {
        adjacencyMatrix = new int[numberOfVertices][numberOfVertices];
    }

    public void addEdge(int source, int destination) {
        adjacencyMatrix[source][destination] = 1; // For directed graph
        // Uncomment the line below for undirected graph
        // adjacencyMatrix[destination][source] = 1; 
    }

    public void display() {
        for (int i = 0; i < adjacencyMatrix.length; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < adjacencyMatrix[i].length; j++) {
                System.out.print(adjacencyMatrix[i][j] + " ");
            }
            System.out.println();
        }
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Adding an Edge**: \(O(1)\)
    - Directly accessing the matrix element requires constant time.
- **Removing an Edge**: \(O(1)\)
    - Similarly, removing an edge also takes constant time.
- **Checking if an Edge Exists**: \(O(1)\)
    - Accessing the matrix to check for an edge is a constant time operation.
- **Iterating over All Edges**: \(O(V^2)\)
    - You need to check each possible edge in the matrix.

### Space Complexity
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(V^2)\)
    - An adjacency matrix uses space proportional to the square of the number of vertices, where \(V\) is the number of vertices.

## 2. Adjacency List

An adjacency list uses a list to represent a graph. Each vertex has a list of adjacent vertices. This representation is more space-efficient for sparse graphs.

```Java
class Graph {
    private List<List<Integer>> adjacencyList;

    public Graph(int numberOfVertices) {
        adjacencyList = new ArrayList<>(numberOfVertices);
        for (int i = 0; i < numberOfVertices; i++) {
            adjacencyList.add(new ArrayList<>());
        }
    }

    public void addEdge(int source, int destination) {
        adjacencyList.get(source).add(destination); // For directed graph
        // Uncomment the line below for undirected graph
        // adjacencyList.get(destination).add(source);
    }

    public void display() {
        for (int i = 0; i < adjacencyList.size(); i++) {
            System.out.print("Vertex " + i + ": ");
            for (int neighbor : adjacencyList.get(i)) {
                System.out.print(neighbor + " ");
            }
            System.out.println();
        }
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Adding an Edge**: \(O(1)\)
    - Adding an edge to a list is a constant time operation.
- **Removing an Edge**: \(O(V)\)
    - In the worst case, you may need to search through the list of neighbors to remove an edge.
- **Checking if an Edge Exists**: \(O(V)\)
    - You may need to traverse the list of adjacent vertices to check for the presence of an edge.
- **Iterating over All Edges**: \(O(E)\)
    - You only iterate through the edges that exist, where \(E\) is the number of edges.

### Space Complexity
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(V + E)\)
    - An adjacency list requires space for all vertices and edges, making it more space-efficient than an adjacency matrix for sparse graphs.

---

## Conclusion
- **Adjacency Matrix**: Efficient for dense graphs but uses more space.
- **Adjacency List**: More space-efficient for sparse graphs but may require more time for certain operations.


# Graph Traversal

## BFS
Breadth-First Search (BFS) is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It explores all the neighbor nodes at the present depth before moving on to nodes at the next depth level. BFS is commonly used to find the shortest path in unweighted graphs.

## Steps of BFS
1. **Initialize**:
    - Create a queue to keep track of the nodes to be explored.
    - Create a list or set to track visited nodes.

2. **Enqueue the Starting Node**:
    - Add the starting node (source) to the queue and mark it as visited.

3. **Dequeue a Node**:
    - Remove the node from the front of the queue.

4. **Process the Node**:
    - Perform the desired operation (e.g., print the node).

5. **Enqueue All Adjacent Nodes**:
    - For each unvisited adjacent node, mark it as visited and enqueue it.

6. **Repeat**:
    - Repeat steps 3-5 until the queue is empty.
    
```java
class Solution {
    public ArrayList<Integer> bfsOfGraph(int V,
                                         ArrayList<ArrayList<Integer>> adj) {

        ArrayList < Integer > bfs = new ArrayList < > ();
        boolean vis[] = new boolean[V];
        Queue < Integer > q = new LinkedList < > ();

        q.add(0);
        vis[0] = true;

        while (!q.isEmpty()) {
            Integer node = q.poll();
            bfs.add(node);

            // Get all adjacent vertices of the dequeued vertex s
            // If a adjacent has not been visited, then mark it
            // visited and enqueue it
            for (Integer it: adj.get(node)) {
                if (vis[it] == false) {
                    vis[it] = true;
                    q.add(it);
                }
            }
        }

        return bfs;
    }

    public static void main(String args[]) {

        ArrayList < ArrayList < Integer >> adj = new ArrayList < > ();
        for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
            adj.add(new ArrayList < > ());
        }
        
        adj.get(4).add(0);
        adj.get(1).add(2);
        adj.get(2).add(1);
        adj.get(1).add(3);
        adj.get(3).add(1);
        adj.get(0).add(1);
        adj.get(1).add(0);
        adj.get(0).add(4);
      

        Solution sl = new Solution();
        ArrayList < Integer > ans = sl.bfsOfGraph(5, adj);
        int n = ans.size();
        for(int i = 0;i<n;i++) {
            System.out.print(ans.get(i)+" ");
        }
    }
}
```
**Time Complexity:** O(N) + O(2E), Where N = Nodes, 2E is for total degrees as we traverse all adjacent nodes.

**Space Complexity:** O(3N) ~ O(N), Space for queue data structure visited array and an adjacency list

### Important:
If we have more than one components in graph then we need to iterate all the vertices and if !visited then need to call *bfsFromVertex()*.

![img.png](Assets/img.png)

```
 for (int i = 0; i < V; i++) {
        if (!vis[i]) {  // Check if the node is unvisited
            bfsFromVertex(i, vis, adj, bfs); // Start BFS for each unvisited node
        }
}
```

## DFS

Depth-First Search (DFS) is an algorithm used to traverse or search through the nodes of a graph. Unlike BFS, which explores neighbors level by level, DFS explores as far down a branch as possible before backtracking. It is useful for exploring all possible paths in a graph and is often used in applications like maze solving, topological sorting, and cycle detection.

## Steps of DFS
1. **Initialize**:
    - Create a stack (or use recursion) to keep track of nodes to visit.
    - Create a list or array to track visited nodes.

2. **Start from a Node**:
    - Push the starting node onto the stack and mark it as visited.

3. **Explore the Graph**:
    - While there are nodes in the stack:
        - Pop a node from the stack.
        - Process the node (e.g., print it or check its edges).
        - Push all unvisited adjacent nodes onto the stack and mark them as visited.

4. **Backtrack**:
    - If there are no unvisited adjacent nodes, backtrack to the previous node by popping from the stack.

5. **Repeat**:
    - Continue until all nodes in the connected component are visited.

## Time and Space Complexity
- **Time Complexity**:
    - \(O(V + E)\)
        - Where \(V\) is the number of vertices and \(E\) is the number of edges. Every vertex and edge is processed once.

- **Space Complexity**:
    - \(O(V)\)
        - In the worst case, all vertices could be stored in the stack (for recursion).
        

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Stack;

class Solution {
    public ArrayList<Integer> dfsOfGraph(int V, ArrayList<ArrayList<Integer>> adj) {
        ArrayList<Integer> dfs = new ArrayList<>();
        boolean[] vis = new boolean[V];

        for (int i = 0; i < V; i++) {
            if (!vis[i]) {  // Check if the node is unvisited
                dfsFromVertex(i, vis, adj, dfs); // Start DFS for each unvisited node
            }
        }

        return dfs;
    }

    private void dfsFromVertex(int node, boolean[] vis, ArrayList<ArrayList<Integer>> adj, ArrayList<Integer> dfs) {
        vis[node] = true; // Mark the node as visited
        dfs.add(node); // Process the node

        // Explore all adjacent vertices
        for (Integer neighbor : adj.get(node)) {
            if (!vis[neighbor]) { // If the neighbor has not been visited
                dfsFromVertex(neighbor, vis, adj, dfs); // Recursively call DFS for the neighbor
            }
        }
    }

    public static void main(String args[]) {
        ArrayList<ArrayList<Integer>> adj = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
            adj.add(new ArrayList<>());
        }

        // Constructing the graph
        adj.get(0).add(1);
        adj.get(1).add(0);
        adj.get(1).add(2);
        adj.get(2).add(1);
        adj.get(1).add(3);
        adj.get(3).add(1);
        adj.get(4).add(0);

        Solution sl = new Solution();
        ArrayList<Integer> ans = sl.dfsOfGraph(5, adj);
        for (int node : ans) {
            System.out.print(node + " ");
        }
    }
}
```

## Cycle Detection in Undirected Graph using BFS
**Hint:** Do BFS, If from a node 'u', you visited node 'v' & if 'v' is already visited and also if 'v' is not parent of 'u' then we can say cycle is there.

![img_4.png](Assets/img_4.png)

```Java
class Solution {
    boolean checkForCycle(ArrayList<ArrayList<Integer>> adj, int s,
                          boolean vis[]) {
        Queue<Node> q = new LinkedList<>(); //BFS
        q.add(new Node(s, -1));
        vis[s] = true;

        // until the queue is empty
        while (!q.isEmpty()) {
            // source node and its parent node
            int node = q.peek().first;
            int par = q.peek().second;
            q.remove();

            // go to all the adjacent nodes
            for (Integer it : adj.get(node)) {
                if (vis[it] == false) {
                    q.add(new Node(it, node));
                    vis[it] = true;
                }

                // if adjacent node is visited and is not its own parent node
                else if (par != it) return true;
            }
        }

        return false;
    }
}
```
## Cycle Detection in Undirected Graph using DFS

**Hint:** If adjacent node (next node) is already visited then cycle is present

In DFS call we will pass parent and we will check one more condition 

**else if (par != it) return true;**

```Java
class Solution {
    public boolean checkForCycle(int node, int parent, boolean vis[], ArrayList<ArrayList
            <Integer>> adj) {
        vis[node] = true;
        for (Integer it : adj.get(node)) {
            if (vis[it] == false) {
                if (checkForCycle(it, node, vis, adj) == true)
                    return true;
            } else if (it != parent)
                return true;
        }

        return false;
    }

    // 0-based index
    public boolean isCycle(int V, ArrayList < ArrayList < Integer >> adj) {
        boolean vis[] = new boolean[V];
        for (int i = 0; i < V; i++) {
            if (vis[i] == false) {
                if (checkForCycle(i, -1, vis, adj))
                    return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
}
```

## Bipartite Graph (BFS) | Graph Coloring:

A Graph that can be colored using 2 colors such that no two adjacent nodes have same color is called as Bipartite Graph

- Use BFS to traverse the graph, coloring nodes alternately with two colors.
- For each node, color all its uncolored neighbors with the opposite color.
- If you encounter an already-colored neighbor with the same color as the current node, the graph is not bipartite.

```Java
class Solution {
    public boolean isBipartite(int[][] graph) {
        int[] visited = new int[graph.length];
        for(int i=0; i< graph.length;i++){
            if(visited[i]==0 && !helper(graph,i,1,visited)){
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }

    public boolean helper(int[][] graph, int n, int color, int[] visited) {

        Queue<Integer> queue = new LinkedList<>();

        queue.add(n);
        visited[n] = color;
        while(!queue.isEmpty()){
            int size = queue.size();
            System.out.println(size);
            while(size>0){
                int node = queue.remove();
                int nearestColor = visited[node];
                for(int i=0; i< graph[node].length;i++){
                    int nextNode = graph[node][i];
                    if(visited[nextNode] == 0){
                        visited[nextNode] = -nearestColor;
                        queue.add(nextNode);
                    }else{
                        if(visited[nextNode]== nearestColor){
                            return false;
                        }
                    }
                }
                size--;
            }
        }

        return true;
    }
}
```

## Bipartite Graph (DFS)

- Use BFS to traverse the graph, coloring nodes alternately with two colors.
- For each node, color all its uncolored neighbors with the opposite color.
- If you encounter an already-colored neighbor with the same color as the current node, the graph is not bipartite.

```Java

    public boolean isBipartite(int[][] graph) {
        int[] visited = new int[graph.length];
        for(int i=0; i< graph.length;i++){
            if(visited[i]==0 && !helper(graph,i,1,visited)){
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }

    public boolean helper(int[][] graph, int i, int color, int[] visited) {
        if(visited[i]!= 0){
            if(visited[i]!= color){
                return false;
            }
            return true;
        }

        visited[i] = color;
        for(int node: graph[i]){
            if(!helper(graph, node, -color, visited)){
                    return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```

## Cycle Detection in Directed Graph Using DFS
```
3 ---> 4    3 -------4
|      |    |        |
|      |    |        |
V      V    |        |
6 ---> 5    6--------5
No Cycle      Cycle
```

So, we can't use idea of cycle detection of undirected graph

**Hint:**
- **Initialize Structures:** Create two setsâ€”one for tracking visited nodes and another for nodes currently in the path (recursion stack).

- **DFS Traversal:** Start a DFS traversal from each unvisited node. For each node you visit, add it to the current path set.

- **Cycle Detection:** While exploring a nodeâ€™s neighbors, if you encounter a node that is already in the current path set, a cycle is detected.

- **Backtracking:** After exploring all neighbors of a node, remove it from the current path set before backtracking to the previous node.

```Java
class solution{
    private static boolean checkCycle(int node,  ArrayList<ArrayList<Integer>> adj, int vis[], int dfsVis[]) {
        vis[node] = 1;
        dfsVis[node] = 1;

        for(Integer neighbor: adj.get(node)) {
            if(vis[neighbor] == 0) {
                if(checkCycle(neighbor, adj, vis, dfsVis) == true) {
                    return true;
                }
            } else if(dfsVis[neighbor] == 1) {
                return true;
            }
        }
        dfsVis[node] = 0;
        return false;
    }
}
```
